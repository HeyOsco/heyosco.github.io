#### By Oscar K. Sandoval and 2 Anonymous Contributors (Spring 2017)

## **Summary**
![ReMus-Landing](/docs/ReMus/ReMus_Landing.png){:class="img-responsive"}{:height="100%" width="100%"}
<br>
**ReMus** is a platformer where the player must use their hookshot to travel from platform to platform
and collect music notes before music is lost forever. Each level starts off with a dreary background and distorted music, and each time the player collects a certain threshold of notes, the level gradually becomes restored. Should the player collect the required amount of notes to fully restore a level, they are presented with a song that is the order of the notes they had collected throughout the level. Should the player fail, they are presented with a future where music is lost forever.
